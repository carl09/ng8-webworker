//   `You can run whatever code you like inside the worker thread, with some exceptions. For example, you can't directly manipulate the DOM from inside a worker, or use some default methods and properties of the window object. But you can use a large number of items available under window, including WebSockets, and data storage mechanisms like IndexedDB and the Firefox OS-only Data Store API. See Functions and classes available to workers for more details.`,
// `Data is sent between workers and the main thread via a system of messages â€” both sides send their messages using the postMessage() method, and respond to messages via the onmessage event handler (the message is contained within the Message event's data attribute.) The data is copied rather than shared.`,
// `Workers may, in turn, spawn new workers, as long as those workers are hosted within the same origin as the parent page. In addition, workers may use XMLHttpRequest for network I/O, with the exception that the responseXML and channel attributes on XMLHttpRequest always return null.`,
